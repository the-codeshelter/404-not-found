<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)
\*Demo link on top of the page

This is the first step to learn deeper about responsive web development. I learned that it is really important for a website to be responsive because it is accessed from devices with various screen width. The 404 not found page helps building a better user experience (UX) in a website. And also, from what I know, the 404 not found page also prevents clients from seeing server side errors. I'm happy to learn and would be willing to face more challenges in [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io).
